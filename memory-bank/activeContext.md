# Active Context

## Current Focus
Recently completed major database cleanup and sync fixes. Core study functionality is now working. Focus shifting to polish and state management improvements.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

### Database Cleanup (COMPLETED ✅)
1. **Removed Duplicate Records**
   - Cleaned up Supabase database from 245 to 169 unique problems
   - Removed duplicate titles and leetcode number conflicts
   - Used SQL queries to identify and remove duplicates systematically

2. **Fixed Sync Service**
   - Updated `initializeWithSampleData()` to check Supabase before loading samples
   - Prevents duplicate sample data insertion on app startup
   - Now follows proper sync flow: local → remote → sample fallback

3. **UI Navigation Updates**
   - Replaced Progress tab with Explore tab as per design document
   - Updated navigation bar icons and labels
   - Fixed imports and component references

### Current Status Assessment
- ✅ **Navigation Working**: Explore → Study flow functional
- ✅ **Study Flow Working**: Can view problems, rate difficulty, see solutions
- ✅ **Database Clean**: Exactly 169 unique Grind75 problems
- ⚠️ **setState Errors**: StudySessionProvider has console errors but app functions
- ⚠️ **Dashboard Data**: Shows mock data instead of real statistics

## Next Priority Issues

### 1. StudySessionProvider setState Errors
- **Issue**: setState() called during build causing console exceptions
- **Impact**: Console errors, potential instability
- **Location**: `lib/providers/study_session_provider.dart`
- **Fix Required**: Move setState calls to post-frame callbacks

### 2. Dashboard Statistics
- **Issue**: Hardcoded mock data instead of real study session data
- **Impact**: Inaccurate progress tracking
- **Location**: `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` (DashboardView)
- **Fix Required**: Connect to actual study session data, update 0/75 to 0/169

### 3. Study Flow UX
- **Issue**: Unclear what happens after rating difficulty
- **Impact**: User confusion about "Complete" button purpose
- **Location**: `lib/screens/study/flashcard_viewer.dart`
- **Fix Required**: Better labeling and session flow clarity

### 4. Syntax Highlighting
- **Issue**: Basic highlighting (keywords only), variables/strings are white
- **Impact**: Reduced code readability
- **Location**: Study screen syntax highlighting
- **Fix Required**: Better color scheme and theme

## Key Technical Insights

### What's Working Well
- Offline-first architecture with Supabase sync
- Clean Material 3 UI design
- Provider state management (mostly)
- Authentication and data persistence
- Multi-language code template system

### Current Technical Debt
- Provider state management patterns need cleanup
- Error handling inconsistencies
- Loading states could be more polished
- Navigation state management
- Console error cleanup needed

## Development Workflow
- Database operations via Supabase MCP tools
- Local development with Flutter web
- Git workflow for version control
- Memory bank documentation for context

## Active Decisions
- Keeping 169 problems (full Grind75 + extensions)
- Explore tab provides educational value beyond just problem browsing
- Offline-first approach for reliability
- Provider pattern for state management
- Material 3 for consistent modern UI

## Important Patterns
- Always verify database state after operations
- Use MCP tools for database queries and cleanup
- Update memory bank after significant changes
- Test core user flows after major changes
- Maintain clean separation between UI and business logic

## User Experience Focus
- Core study flow must be intuitive
- Progress tracking should be accurate and motivating
- Code readability is crucial for learning
- Navigation should be predictable
- Error states should be handled gracefully

## Next Implementation Plan
See NEXT_FIXES_PLAN.md for detailed roadmap focusing on:
1. State management fixes
2. Dashboard data connection
3. UX improvements
4. Documentation updates
