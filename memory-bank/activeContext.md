# Active Context - LeetCode Flashcards App

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
**Complete Grind 75 dataset upload to Supabase database**

The app currently has 34+ flashcards in the database but needs all 169 Grind 75 problems to be fully functional. Multiple upload scripts have been created but encountered technical issues.

### Recent Changes (Last Session)

#### 1. Database Schema Cleanup
- **Action**: Removed week-based organization from database schema
- **Reason**: Week structure was artificial constraint; users should access all problems
- **Impact**: Simplified data model, more flexible problem access
- **Status**: âœ… Complete

#### 2. Upload Script Development
- **Created**: Multiple upload scripts to batch-insert Grind 75 problems
- **Scripts**: `upload_all_grind75.dart`, `upload_all_169_grind75.dart`, `upload_existing_questions.dart`
- **Issues**: Type mismatches, import problems, data structure inconsistencies
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - scripts created but not successfully executed

#### 3. Data Source Analysis
- **Discovered**: `lib/data/grind75_questions.dart` contains List<Flashcard> not Map structure
- **Current Data**: ~6 problems in local file vs. 169 needed
- **Implication**: Need to either expand local data or use direct SQL insertion
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ Pending - need data strategy decision

### Active Decisions and Considerations

#### Upload Strategy Options
1. **Flutter App Upload**: Create working Flutter app to batch upload
   - Pros: Uses existing models and services
   - Cons: Requires fixing import/type issues

2. **Direct SQL Insertion**: Use Supabase MCP to insert via SQL
   - Pros: Bypasses Flutter/Dart complications
   - Cons: Manual JSON formatting, no validation

3. **Expand Local Data**: Add all 169 problems to grind75_questions.dart
   - Pros: Consistent with existing pattern
   - Cons: Large file, manual data entry

#### Current Recommendation
**Proceed with Direct SQL Insertion** - fastest path to completion given time constraints and technical issues with Flutter scripts.

### Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1. **Complete Dataset Upload** (High Priority)
   - Use Supabase MCP to insert remaining ~135 problems directly
   - Start with most common/important problems first
   - Verify data integrity after upload

2. **Test Core Functionality** (High Priority)
   - Verify spaced repetition algorithm works with larger dataset
   - Test study session flow with variety of problems
   - Ensure offline sync functions properly

3. **Enhanced UI Polish** (Medium Priority)
   - Improve flashcard viewer interface
   - Add progress visualization
   - Implement study mode filters

### Important Patterns and Preferences

#### Data Management
- **Offline-First**: Always prioritize local SQLite as source of truth
- **Sync Strategy**: Background sync, never block UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when cloud unavailable

#### Code Organization
- **Provider Pattern**: Centralized state management
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data layer for testability
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation

#### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Small, testable changes
- **Mobile-First**: Optimize for phone screen and touch interaction
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, efficient queries

### Learnings and Project Insights

#### Technical Discoveries
1. **Flutter Build Complexity**: Cross-platform builds can fail due to minor syntax issues
2. **Supabase Integration**: Direct SQL often more reliable than complex Dart serialization
3. **Data Modeling**: Simple flat structures often better than nested hierarchies
4. **State Management**: Provider pattern works well for reactive UI updates

#### Product Insights
1. **User Focus**: Quick access to next problem more important than complex organization
2. **Content Quality**: Better to have fewer high-quality problems than many mediocre ones
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators crucial for motivation
4. **Mobile Usage**: App primarily used in short 10-20 minute sessions

#### Process Learning
1. **Prototype First**: Build minimal working version before adding features
2. **Data Strategy**: Establish data pipeline early in development
3. **Testing on Device**: Simulator/emulator doesn't catch all issues
4. **Documentation**: Memory bank system essential for context continuity

### Current Blockers

#### Technical Blockers
- **Flutter Import Issues**: Multiple upload scripts have circular dependency problems
- **Data Type Mismatches**: Inconsistency between local Flashcard model and database expectations
- **Build System**: Android build failures preventing script execution

#### Process Blockers
- **Data Source**: No definitive source for all 169 Grind 75 problems with solutions
- **Time Constraints**: Manual data entry would take significant time

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk
- **Incomplete Dataset**: App not usable without sufficient problem variety
- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent problem formatting could break user experience

#### Medium Risk
- **Performance**: Large dataset might slow mobile app
- **Sync Complexity**: Offline/online transitions could cause data corruption

#### Low Risk
- **Feature Completeness**: Core functionality works with current architecture
- **Platform Support**: Architecture supports all target platforms
