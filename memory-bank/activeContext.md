# Active Context - LeetCode Flashcards App

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
**Project is now live on GitHub with full repository setup complete**

The Flutter flashcard app has been successfully migrated to GitHub with proper git MCP server integration for ongoing development workflow automation.

### Recent Changes (Current Session)

#### 1. Git MCP Server Setup âœ…
- **Action**: Installed and configured git MCP server from modelcontextprotocol/servers
- **Installation**: Used pipx at `/Users/moharnab/.local/bin/mcp-server-git`
- **Configuration**: Added to `cline_mcp_settings.json` with repository path
- **Tools Available**: git_status, git_add, git_commit, git_diff, git_log, git_reset, etc.
- **Status**: âœ… Complete and operational

#### 2. GitHub Repository Creation âœ…
- **Repository**: https://github.com/moharnab123saikia/flashcode
- **Description**: "A Flutter flashcard app with spaced repetition algorithm for effective learning"
- **Visibility**: Public repository
- **Status**: âœ… Complete with all project files pushed

#### 3. Repository Cleanup âœ…
- **Issue**: Build artifacts (Android .gradle, .iml, macOS Pods) were initially included
- **Resolution**: Removed build artifacts while keeping essential platform configuration
- **Cleanup**: Proper .gitignore enforcement and repository hygiene
- **Status**: âœ… Complete - repository follows Flutter best practices

### Previous Session Work

#### 1. Database Schema Cleanup
- **Action**: Removed week-based organization from database schema
- **Reason**: Week structure was artificial constraint; users should access all problems
- **Impact**: Simplified data model, more flexible problem access
- **Status**: âœ… Complete

#### 2. Upload Script Development
- **Created**: Multiple upload scripts to batch-insert Grind 75 problems
- **Scripts**: `upload_all_grind75.dart`, `upload_all_169_grind75.dart`, `upload_existing_questions.dart`
- **Issues**: Type mismatches, import problems, data structure inconsistencies
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - scripts created but not successfully executed

#### 3. Data Source Analysis
- **Discovered**: `lib/data/grind75_questions.dart` contains List<Flashcard> not Map structure
- **Current Data**: ~6 problems in local file vs. 169 needed
- **Implication**: Need to either expand local data or use direct SQL insertion
- **Status**: ðŸ“‹ Pending - need data strategy decision

### Active Decisions and Considerations

#### Development Workflow Strategy
1. **Git MCP Integration**: Use git MCP server for automated workflow
   - Pros: Seamless commit, push, and repository management
   - Cons: Learning curve for MCP tools
   - Status: âœ… Implemented and working

2. **Repository Structure**: Keep platform directories vs. build-only approach
   - Decision: Keep android/, ios/, macos/ with essential config files only
   - Rationale: Required for Flutter platform support
   - Implementation: Removed build artifacts, kept configuration
   - Status: âœ… Complete

3. **Upload Strategy**: Still need to complete Grind 75 dataset
   - **Direct SQL Insertion**: Use Supabase MCP to insert via SQL
   - **Git Workflow**: Now have proper version control for tracking changes
   - **Current Priority**: Complete dataset upload with git tracking

#### Current Recommendation
**Use Git MCP workflow for all development** - now have proper version control and automation tools in place for efficient development.

### Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1. **Complete Dataset Upload** (High Priority)
   - Use Supabase MCP to insert remaining ~135 problems directly
   - Track changes using git MCP workflow
   - Verify data integrity after upload
   - Commit data population progress to repository

2. **Development Workflow Enhancement** (High Priority)
   - Leverage git MCP tools for efficient development
   - Use proper branching strategy for feature development
   - Implement commit message standards for better tracking
   - Utilize repository for collaboration and backup

3. **Test Core Functionality** (High Priority)
   - Verify spaced repetition algorithm works with larger dataset
   - Test study session flow with variety of problems
   - Ensure offline sync functions properly
   - Document testing results in git commits

4. **Enhanced UI Polish** (Medium Priority)
   - Improve flashcard viewer interface
   - Add progress visualization
   - Implement study mode filters
   - Track UI improvements through git history

### Important Patterns and Preferences

#### Data Management
- **Offline-First**: Always prioritize local SQLite as source of truth
- **Sync Strategy**: Background sync, never block UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when cloud unavailable

#### Code Organization
- **Provider Pattern**: Centralized state management
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data layer for testability
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation

#### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Small, testable changes with git tracking
- **Mobile-First**: Optimize for phone screen and touch interaction
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, efficient queries
- **Version Control**: Proper git workflow with meaningful commits
- **Documentation**: Update memory bank and commit messages regularly

#### Git Workflow Patterns
- **Clean Repository**: Keep build artifacts out, essential config in
- **Meaningful Commits**: Clear commit messages describing changes
- **MCP Integration**: Use git MCP tools for automated workflow
- **Backup Strategy**: GitHub serves as both collaboration and backup

### Learnings and Project Insights

#### Technical Discoveries
1. **Flutter Build Complexity**: Cross-platform builds can fail due to minor syntax issues
2. **Supabase Integration**: Direct SQL often more reliable than complex Dart serialization
3. **Data Modeling**: Simple flat structures often better than nested hierarchies
4. **State Management**: Provider pattern works well for reactive UI updates
5. **Git MCP Integration**: Automated git workflow significantly improves development efficiency
6. **Repository Management**: Proper .gitignore and artifact exclusion critical for clean repos

#### Product Insights
1. **User Focus**: Quick access to next problem more important than complex organization
2. **Content Quality**: Better to have fewer high-quality problems than many mediocre ones
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators crucial for motivation
4. **Mobile Usage**: App primarily used in short 10-20 minute sessions

#### Process Learning
1. **Prototype First**: Build minimal working version before adding features
2. **Data Strategy**: Establish data pipeline early in development
3. **Testing on Device**: Simulator/emulator doesn't catch all issues
4. **Documentation**: Memory bank system essential for context continuity
5. **Version Control**: Early git setup prevents lost work and enables collaboration
6. **MCP Tools**: Leverage MCP servers for workflow automation and efficiency

### Current Blockers

#### Technical Blockers
- **Flutter Import Issues**: Multiple upload scripts have circular dependency problems
- **Data Type Mismatches**: Inconsistency between local Flashcard model and database expectations
- **Build System**: Android build failures preventing script execution

#### Process Blockers
- **Data Source**: No definitive source for all 169 Grind 75 problems with solutions
- **Time Constraints**: Manual data entry would take significant time

#### Resolved Blockers âœ…
- **Version Control**: âœ… Git repository setup complete with GitHub integration
- **Development Workflow**: âœ… Git MCP server provides automated workflow tools
- **Repository Structure**: âœ… Clean repository following Flutter best practices
- **Backup Strategy**: âœ… Code safely backed up to GitHub with proper history

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk
- **Incomplete Dataset**: App not usable without sufficient problem variety
- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent problem formatting could break user experience

#### Medium Risk
- **Performance**: Large dataset might slow mobile app
- **Sync Complexity**: Offline/online transitions could cause data corruption

#### Low Risk
- **Feature Completeness**: Core functionality works with current architecture
- **Platform Support**: Architecture supports all target platforms
