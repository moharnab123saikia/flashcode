# Product Context - LeetCode Flashcards App

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Technical interview preparation is often inefficient and stressful:
- **Information Overload**: 1000+ LeetCode problems can be overwhelming
- **Poor Retention**: Solving problems once doesn't guarantee long-term memory
- **Lack of Structure**: No clear progression path for systematic learning
- **Time Constraints**: Busy professionals need efficient study methods
- **Pattern Recognition**: Difficulty identifying common algorithmic patterns

### Solution Approach
A focused, science-based approach to algorithm mastery:
- **Curated Problem Set**: Focus on Grind 75 - the most impactful 169 problems
- **Spaced Repetition**: Scientific method proven to improve long-term retention
- **Mobile-First**: Study anywhere, anytime with offline capabilities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Organized by data structures and algorithmic patterns
- **Progress Tracking**: Quantified learning with difficulty adjustment

## Target User Problems

### Primary Personas

#### 1. Job-Seeking Software Engineer
- **Pain**: Limited time to prepare while working full-time
- **Goal**: Maximize interview success with efficient preparation
- **Behavior**: Studies during commute, lunch breaks, evenings
- **Success Metric**: Landing interviews at target companies

#### 2. Computer Science Student
- **Pain**: Academic algorithms don't translate to interview success
- **Goal**: Bridge gap between theory and practical problem-solving
- **Behavior**: Regular study sessions, seeks pattern understanding
- **Success Metric**: Internship and new grad job offers

#### 3. Career Switcher

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience

#### Study Flow
1. **Quick Access**: Open app → immediate problem presentation
2. **Focused Learning**: Single problem with hint system
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Language-specific optimized approaches
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Rate difficulty → algorithm schedules next review
5. **Progress Visualization**: Clear advancement through problem set

#### Spaced Repetition Integration
- **Initial Learning**: New problems introduced gradually
- **Review Scheduling**: Problems resurface based on personal difficulty
- **Adaptive Intervals**: Success increases interval, failure decreases it
- **Long-term Retention**: Problems mastered are reviewed less frequently

### Key Interactions

#### Problem Study Session
```
1. Problem Title + Difficulty Level
2. Problem Statement (clean, focused)
3. Hint System (progressive disclosure)
4. Solution Toggle (multiple languages)
5. Complexity Analysis (time/space)
6. Personal Rating (1-4 difficulty scale)
7. Next Problem Transition
```

#### Progress Dashboard
```
1. Overall Statistics (problems solved, streak, accuracy)
2. Category Breakdown (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.)
3. Difficulty Distribution (easy/medium/hard progress)
4. Review Calendar (upcoming scheduled reviews)
5. Achievement Badges (streak milestones, category mastery)
```
