## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach vs. Current
**Original Plan**: Week-based problem organization matching Grind 75 structure
**Current Approach**: Flat problem organization with global ordering
**Reason**: Week structure was artificial constraint, users prefer flexible access

**Original Plan**: Complex nested data structures for solutions
**Current Approach**: Simple JSONB storage with flexible schema
**Reason**: Easier to manage and query, more maintainable

**Original Plan**: Authentication-first approach
**Current Approach**: Anonymous-first with optional account creation
**Reason**: Lower barrier to entry, faster user onboarding

### Technical Decisions
**Database**: Chose Supabase over Firebase for better SQL support and cost structure
**State Management**: Provider over BLoC for simpler learning curve and faster development
**Architecture**: Repository pattern for testability and offline-first requirements
**UI Framework**: Material Design for consistent cross-platform experience
**Version Control**: Git with MCP server integration for automated workflow
**Repository Hosting**: GitHub for backup, collaboration, and project visibility

### Lessons Learned
1. **Start Simple**: Complex data structures create more problems than they solve
2. **Mobile-First**: Touch interactions and small screens drive design decisions
3. **Offline-First**: Network reliability cannot be assumed, local storage is critical
4. **User Testing**: Early feedback revealed week structure was confusing
5. **Data Quality**: Better to have fewer high-quality problems than many poor ones

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### High Priority Issues
- **Upload Scripts**: Flutter build failures preventing data population
- **Error States**: Limited error handling could cause poor user experience
- **Performance**: No optimization for large datasets

### Medium Priority Issues
- **Code Coverage**: Insufficient test coverage, especially integration tests
- **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation and architectural guides
- **Monitoring**: No crash reporting or performance monitoring

### Low Priority Issues
- **Code Generation**: Manual model updates, could be more automated
- **Asset Management**: Images and fonts could be better organized
- **Platform Polish**: Missing platform-specific UI enhancements

## Success Metrics and KPIs
