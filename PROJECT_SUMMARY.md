## 📝 Known Issues & Solutions

### macOS Network Permissions
If you see "Operation not permitted" errors:
1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy
2. Add your terminal/IDE to allowed apps for network access
3. Or run with: `flutter run --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key`

### Supabase Connection
The app works offline by default. To enable cloud sync:
1. Ensure Supabase project is running
2. Check network permissions
3. Verify credentials in `lib/services/config.dart`
